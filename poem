Dear all,
 
one achieving more perfection
transcending into every direction
assuming the role of elevator
how can one be awesome creator ?
 
code must be simple and clean
understood by the whole team
syntax and overall structure
style in harmony with culture
 
important for one to understand
focus solving the problem at hand
not some fancy too general version
that exists only in imagination
 
from quick hacks to robust solutions
and wisdom guiding one's contributions
balancing costs, time and quality
actions that bring results to reality
 
humility, perseverance, self-improvement
massive experience, yet always student
growth mindset, knowledge, perspective
intuitive, flexible, highly objective
 
accepting gracefully any new tasks
availability when someone asks
feeling responsible to act
loving to cause positive impact
 
proper tools and methodologies
choosing the correct technologies
spending some time making selections
careful research, meets expectations
 
healthy skepticism over own code
even in days with heavy workload
testing, collecting every bug found
fixing to ensure the branch is sound
 
highly reliable pursuing goals
strong work ethic one controls
timely to meetings always showing
correct estimates usually flowing
 
advanced skills in communication
coherent problem-solution relation
deep connections with the team
clarity emits one's aura stream
 
keeping always positive attitude
taking feedback with gratitude
willingness to go the distance
get the job done with persistence
 
every start with a clean slate
brain biases left at the gate
open relations, proactive exchange
coordinates to grow influential range
 
acting as mentor elevating others
for pair programming makes gathers
constructive dialogue alleviating concern
genuine delight supporting people learn
 
aware observing interactions
avoiding making assumptions
kind and generous, truly not phony
jokes about self or life only
 
excel at stakeholder management
unique insight generating excitement
eager to add value and volunteers
huge productivity gain for peers
 
diverse perspectives one considers
actual peak experiences delivers
artistic, emotional, aesthetic sense
powerful attributes, keys to success
 
big picture marathon, not sprint
fulfillment even being skint
divine connection with god in frame
leading everyone to feel the same
 
vision and plan with frontal cortex
build strategy around business context
design, develop, manage to outperform
hierarchy structure, synergy as a whole
 
Best
Leo
